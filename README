hacks are c++ - not processing - and require a custom version of

  tobiasb bielohlawek's "Arduino.mk"
  https://github.com/rngtng/Arduino.mk

i'm working on cleaning this up and making them work out of the box with 

  martin's atelier's "Arduino from the command line" 
  http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html

in the meantime, i'll post my hacked version of Arduino.mk
