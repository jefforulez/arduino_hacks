== introduction ==

hacks are c++ - not processing - and require a custom version of

  tobiasb bielohlawek's "Arduino.mk"
  https://github.com/rngtng/Arduino.mk

i'm working on cleaning this up and making them work out of the box with

  martin's atelier's "Arduino from the command line"
  http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html

in the meantime, i'll post my hacked version of Arduino.mk


== compiling hacks ==

i currently use the following setup to compile my arduino code:

; macos 10.7.x

; arduino 1.0 downloaded and installed
: http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software

; added my hacked version of Arduino.mk to the PATH
: export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/local-dropbox/github/arduino_hacks/arduino-mk-0.6-jeffo"

; created a libraries/ folder
: mkdir $HOME/local-dropbox/github/arduino_hacks/libraries

; downloaded and unpacked the LoLShield library in the libraries/ folder
: http://code.google.com/p/lolshield/downloads/detail?name=LoLShield%20v23.zip

  > ls -l ./libraries/
  total 0
  drwxrwxr-x  13 jeffo  staff  442 Jan 14 17:12 LoLShield

once the environment is setup, i cd to the project directory and run make:

  > cd ~/local-dropbox/github/arduino_hacks/lolshield/zelda
  > make && make upload
