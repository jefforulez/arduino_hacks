== introduction ==

this project was born of three requirements:

1. the @blip office has an irc server that people actually use
2. the @blip irc server has a bot - plusplusbot - that keeps score when people get ++'s and --'s
3. @rickyrobinett invited me to hack-o-latern 2013 ( #HOL2013 ) and i didn't realize i could say no.

== overview ==

the goal of this project is simple:  announce plusplusbot awards via an LED-illuminated jack-o-lantern

== code ==

; irc gateway : ./pumpkinbot_js

  node.js app that monitors irc for plusplusbot awards and relays them to an arduino
  
; LED controller : ./pumpkinbot_cc
  
  ethernet shield -> arduino -> LED-laden pumpkin
