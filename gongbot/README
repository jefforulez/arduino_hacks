== introduction ==

the @blip office has several characteristics that made this project a necessity:

1. gongs.  we have two of them.
2. nerf guns.  we have way more than two of them.
3. irc.  we only have one irc server, but it has lots of users

== overview ==

the goal of this project is simple:  announce nerf-to-gong interactions in irc.

== code ==

this project went through several configurations - hardware and software - before 
i settled on the following setup:

; sensor : ./gong_sensor_ethernet
  
  piezo transducer -> arduino uno -> ethernet shield 
      
; irc gateway : ./gong_bot_js

  node.js app running on my work imac
  

there's code in here for other working, rubegoldbergesque, configurations:


i. xbee-to-ethernet configuration

; sensor : ./gong_sensor 

  pieze transducer -> arduino uno -> xbee 
  
; receiver : ./gong_receiver

  xbee -> arduino uno -> ethernet shield
  
; irc gateway : ./gong_bot

  perl script that listens for gong events on a tcp/ip socket
  

ii. xbee-to-serial configuration

; sensor : ./gong_sensor 

  pieze transducer -> arduino uno -> xbee 
  
; receiver : ./gong_receiver_serial

  xbee -> arduino uno -> serial usb
  
; irc gateway : ./gong_bot

  perl script that listens for gong events on serial /dev
